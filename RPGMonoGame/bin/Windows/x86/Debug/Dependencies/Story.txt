"|if|(inWar){The War between {WarFactionName} and }|else|{}
The War between {WarFactionName} and Affrieca has been raging on since I was born.
I wake up on a cold floor in a foreign room
Everyone I knew has either died or was taken prisoner, except for me.
?:"You there! On your feet!"
?:"State Your Name, Now!"
*... W-what?
*Where am I?
Toto:"I... I am Toto of Affri-"
?:"Affrieca is no more stand up and follow me."
*I hate it...

We are walking through a dark hallway
I don't trust this man...
*He has his back turned
*If I can make one swift strike I may be able to escape...
*Well... It is now or never.

I won...
I have no idea where I am so I believe it will be best to settle down.
